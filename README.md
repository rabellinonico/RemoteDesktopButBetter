# RemoteDesktopButBetter (Windows RDP Manager)

RemoteDesktopButBetter (RDBB) is an open-source Windows desktop application that helps you organize, manage, and launch multiple Remote Desktop (RDP) connections efficiently.

It is designed for developers, system administrators, IT professionals, and power users who work daily with Microsoft Remote Desktop and need a simple way to keep their RDP connections structured and accessible.

## What is RemoteDesktopButBetter?

RemoteDesktopButBetter is a lightweight Remote Desktop connection manager for Windows that allows you to group, save, and reuse RDP connections without repeatedly configuring them.

Instead of managing multiple `.rdp` files or manually entering IP addresses, RDBB provides a centralized interface to improve productivity and lost of memory.

## Key Features

- Organize Remote Desktop (RDP) connections into customizable groups
- Save multiple RDP entries per group
- Store a description and IP address for each connection
- Quickly add, edit, sort, and delete groups and servers
- One-click connection to selected Remote Desktop servers
- Simple, clean, and lightweight Windows user interface

## How It Works

RDBB lets you divide your Remote Desktop connections into logical groups (for example: environments, projects, customers, or teams).

Each group contains a list of RDP connections, and each connection saves:
- A custom description
- The target server IP address

Once configured, you can select a group, choose a server, and connect instantly using Microsoft Remote Desktop.
